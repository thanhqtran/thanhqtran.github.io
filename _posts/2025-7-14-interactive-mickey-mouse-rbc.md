An interactive tool to visualize the impulse response functions (IRF) and stochastic simulations of a ``mickey mouse" RBC model.


Live version: [https://thanhqtran.shinyapps.io/rbc_demo/](https://thanhqtran.shinyapps.io/rbc_demo/)


Here, you can play with a variety of parameters and see how the steady state and IRFs change.


The solution technique is the Method of Undetermined Coefficients ([Christiano, 2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020534927853)), which is used intensively in [McCandless (2008)].
